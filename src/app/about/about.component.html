        Hey there! My name is Taylor Tu and I'm from New Jersey. In 2018, I
        graduated magna cum laude from the New Jersey Institute of Technology
        with a bachelors in Computer Science and Applied Math. There I honed my
        skills and deepened my love for coding. I like the challenge of figuring
        out how to solve problems using as few resources as possible. See below
        for my experience and some of the projects I have created in my free
        time.
