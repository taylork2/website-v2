    <p>
      RDE Systems is a technology consultancy company that serves the public
      health sector. As part of a small team, I designed and developed a
      messaging system using Angular to facilitate communication between AIDS
      patients and their caseworkers. I also created a Coldfusion API and
      integrated this messaging system into a larger webapp which ensured
      patients living with AIDS and HIV have access to medication.

    <p>
      Trillium is a high stakes trading company located in New York City. At
      Trillium LABS, I collaborated with a team web app to display trading data
      in graphical and intuitive manner using WebGL, HTML5 canvas, and JS. I
      added new features based on customer feedback such as resizable windows,
      graphical functions, zoom, and stock search which simplified user
      interactions and provided better market picture. Furthermore, I responded
      to ticket issues, developed bug fixes, & pushed changes using JIRA and
      TortoiseSVN.
