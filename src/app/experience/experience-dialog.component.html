   <p>RDE Systems is a technology consultancy company that serves the public health sector. 
       As part of a small team, I designed and developed a messaging system using Angular to 
       facilitate communication between AIDS patients and their caseworkers. I also created a 
       Coldfusion API and integrated this messaging system into a larger webapp which ensured 
       patients living with AIDS and HIV have access to medication.</p>
